description: The goal of this project was to write a simple parallel query engine using C. A search engine (like Google) has three main components, a crawler that finds and stores copies of files on the web, an indexer that creates a data structure that is efficient for searching, and a query engine that performs the searches requested by users. The query engine uses the indexes produced by the second component to identify documents that match the search term.
