description: Worked in a team of five to create an application to monitor news sources for certain topics to be monitored for key insights. The main problem to be solved was that the client wanted the application to map the sources for each news article over time so as to see which one gets referenced the most. Another small portion of the application was to monitor the tweets based on the handles for these topics. All of this information was shown visually in directed graphs for easy understanding.
